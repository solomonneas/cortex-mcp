# Changelog

All notable changes to cortex-mcp are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project aims
to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Maintainer-health docs: `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`,
  GitHub issue forms (`bug`, `feature`, `config`), and a pull request template
  with a no-PII / safety-gate checklist.
- This changelog.

### Changed

- Rewrote the README to lead with what the server is, why it exists, and how it
  differs; added a copy-paste MCP client config using `npx -y thehive-cortex-mcp`,
  a prominent website link, and "Why not something else?" / "What cortex-mcp is
  not" sections. Documentation only; no change to the server, tools, or behavior.

## [1.2.0]

### Added

- 31 MCP tools spanning the Cortex API: status, analyzers, analyzer definitions,
  jobs, responders, responder definitions, bulk analysis, and superadmin
  organization/user management.
- 4 MCP resources and 4 guided prompts (analyze-observable, investigate-ioc,
  setup-cortex, triage-alert).
- Observable data-type auto-detection and capped analyzer fan-out
  (`CORTEX_MAX_FANOUT`).
- Safety gates: confirmation-required destructive tools, responder execution
  behind `CORTEX_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE`, `CORTEX_FILE_BASE_DIR`-confined file reads,
  and scoped SSL verification.
