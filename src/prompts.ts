Investigation steps:
1. Use cortex_analyze_observable to run all applicable analyzers against this IOC
2. For each analyzer result:
   - Note the taxonomy level (malicious/suspicious/info/safe)
   - Record specific findings (detection names, scores, categories)
3. Use cortex_get_job_artifacts on each completed job to find related IOCs
4. Cross-reference findings across analyzers:
   - Do multiple analyzers flag this as malicious?
   - Are there consistent detection patterns?
   - What categories/families are identified?
5. For any extracted artifacts (related IPs, domains, hashes):
   - List them as potential pivot points for further investigation
6. Provide a final assessment:
   - Confidence level (high/medium/low) based on analyzer consensus
   - Recommended response actions
   - Suggested responder actions if applicable (use cortex_list_responders to check)`,

Steps:
1. Use cortex_get_status to verify the instance is healthy
2. Use cortex_list_analyzers to check what's already enabled
3. Use cortex_list_analyzer_definitions${freeFilter}${dtFilter} to find available analyzers
4. For analyzers that require NO configuration (freeOnly=true):
   - Enable them with cortex_enable_analyzer using empty configuration {}
   - These are safe to enable immediately
5. For analyzers that need API keys:
   - List their required configurationItems
   - Ask the user which API keys they have available
   - Enable those analyzers with the provided keys
6. Use cortex_list_responder_definitions to find available responders
7. Enable any useful responders
8. Verify the setup:
   - Use cortex_list_analyzers to show all enabled analyzers
   - Group them by data type coverage
   - Identify any gaps in coverage
9. Suggest a test: run cortex_analyze_observable on a known-safe IP like 8.8.8.8

Provide a summary table of:
- Analyzers enabled (grouped by data type)
- Data types with coverage vs gaps
- Responders enabled
- Suggested next steps (API keys to add for better coverage)`,

Triage workflow:
1. For each observable (${observableList.length} total):
   a. Use cortex_analyze_observable to run all applicable analyzers
   b. Note the data type (auto-detected) and results
2. Cross-correlate findings:
   - Which observables are flagged as malicious?
   - Are there connections between the observables (same campaign, same threat actor)?
   - Check job artifacts for additional IOCs not in the original alert
3. Risk assessment:
   - Overall severity: Critical / High / Medium / Low / Informational
   - Confidence level based on analyzer consensus
   - False positive likelihood
4. Recommended actions:
   - Immediate containment steps
   - Which responders to execute (use cortex_list_responders)
   - Additional observables to investigate
   - Escalation recommendation
